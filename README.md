# XSoc Python Week 1 

Resources for Week 1. If you have not used GitHub before, you can view files by clicking on them and then download them from there! 

## Why GitHub? 

It's awkward to edit Jupyter files on Google Drives! 
The [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1adhxMDU5yfMzeUqmRsKioPKwqc9905-S?usp=drive_link) should be updated from the GitHub before the course runs (we update the Google Drive for non-technical people who may be uncomfortable using GitHub).
